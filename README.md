Frontend has its own repo https://github.com/vakhtangaA/url-shortener-frontend. \
In main app frontend build is used as static content.

For frontend I used Material-UI, as I was  familiar with it and it offers great flexibility.\
User authentication is handled by auth0.

#### Features

1. User authentication
2. Link shortening
3. Profile page
4. Dashboard page where you can see all urls in database with their corresponding short urls

#### Joke 

If you put very short url and shorten it, app would make it longer ðŸ˜„ this is because of long heroku doamin. With proper, short domain it would be better looking, so please use long urls :d
